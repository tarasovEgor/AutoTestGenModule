In computer science, an algorithm is a step-by-step set of operations designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms are the backbone of all computing processes, ranging from simple sorting procedures to complex artificial intelligence operations. They can be expressed in natural language, pseudocode, or programming languages. One key property of an algorithm is that it must be deterministic â€” meaning that given the same input, it will always produce the same output. Efficiency is measured in terms of time complexity and space complexity, which indicate how the algorithm scales with input size. For example, a linear search has a time complexity of O(n), while a binary search operates in O(log n) time. Designing efficient algorithms is a central task in computer science and has widespread applications in data science, cryptography, robotics, and many other fields.
