Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. After graduating high school in Oakland, Hanks attended junior college before transferring into the theater program at California State University. He spent his summers acting and working at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Ohio until 1980 when he dropped out of college and moved to New York City. That same year, Hanks was cast as Kip Wilson on the sitcom Bosom Buddies, one of two advertising executives who dress in drag in order to rent an apartment in an all-female building. The exposure led to guest roles on Happy Days, Taxi, The Love Boat, and Family Ties.
Ron Howard remembered Hanks from his guest stint on Happy Days, and the actor starred in Howard's 1984 hit Splash opposite Daryl Hannah. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard would go on to work together on Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons.
In 1988, Penny Marshall cast Hanks in a star-making role in Big. his performance earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and established his reputation as a box-office draw as well as a talented actor. Hanks' portrayal in Nora Ephron's 1993 hit Sleepless in Seattle with co-star Meg Ryan ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation. But it was his courageous performance of a lawyer fired from his high-paying firm because he has AIDS in Philadelphia that won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Hanks followed in 1994 with the phenomenal box office success Forrest Gump and brought home his second-straight Best Actor Oscar, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat after Spencer Tracy.
