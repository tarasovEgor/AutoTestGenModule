The law of supply and demand is a fundamental principle in economics that explains how prices are determined in a free market. Supply refers to the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices, while demand refers to the quantity that consumers are willing and able to purchase. When demand for a product increases and supply remains constant, prices tend to rise. Conversely, if supply increases but demand stays the same, prices tend to fall. This interaction creates an equilibrium price â€” the point at which supply equals demand. Market equilibrium is essential for the efficient allocation of resources. External factors, such as government policies, global events, and technological advancements, can shift supply or demand, leading to surpluses or shortages. Understanding this concept helps explain various economic phenomena like inflation, market bubbles, and price controls.
