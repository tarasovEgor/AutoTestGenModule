DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material found in all living organisms. It is composed of two long strands forming a double helix, made up of nucleotides that include the bases adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These bases pair specifically (A with T, C with G) to create a stable structure that can be copied and passed on during cell division. DNA contains genes, which are sequences of nucleotides that provide instructions for building proteins. These proteins are responsible for virtually all cellular functions, from structural roles to enzymes that facilitate chemical reactions. The human genome contains over 20,000 genes, and the study of DNA has led to major breakthroughs in medicine, such as identifying genetic disorders and developing personalized treatments. Techniques like CRISPR now allow scientists to edit DNA with precision, opening the door to curing diseases previously thought to be untreatable.
