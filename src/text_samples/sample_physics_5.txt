General relativity is a theory of gravitation proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, revolutionizing our understanding of gravity. Unlike Newtonian gravity, which describes gravity as a force between masses, general relativity explains gravity as the result of the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of space and time around them, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects. One famous prediction of the theory is that time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields â€” a phenomenon confirmed by atomic clocks placed at different altitudes. General relativity also predicted the existence of black holes and gravitational waves, both of which have been observed in recent years. This theory is essential for modern technologies like GPS, which must account for relativistic time differences to provide accurate location data.
